## FAQ

1. **Some files are being deleted and/or my anti-virus is detecting rbxfpsunlocker as malware. What do I do?**
Any detections are most likely a false positive. If you don't trust me, feel free to download the repository and compile the project from source. Otherwise, add an exception to your antivirus for `rbxfpsunlocker.exe` (or the folder it is in).

##  Disclaimer

Around June 21st, 2018 I received reports that Roblox was [handing out bans](https://i.imgur.com/i4NEGB0.png) to players using this tool. Roblox most likely assumes that `rbxfpsunlocker.dll` is an exploit or a cheat. I fixed this issue in [release 1.6](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker/releases/tag/v1.6) and can confirm injecting rbxfpsunlocker is now "invisible" to Roblox. **HOWEVER, this won't stop Roblox from releasing a new detection in the future. Please use this tool at your own risk** and keep in touch with this repository for updates.

<sub>roblox this isn't an exploit no bans please :(</sub>
