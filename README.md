## FAQ

1. **Some files are being deleted and/or my anti-virus is detecting rbxfpsunlocker as malware. What do I do?**

Any detections are most likely a false positive. If you don't trust me, feel free to download the repository and compile the project from source. Otherwise, add an exception to your anti-virus for `rbxfpsunlocker.exe` (or the folder it is in).

1. **How can I see my FPS?**

Press **Shift+F5** while in-game to view your FPS. This won't work for Roblox Studio (use a program like Fraps to view FPS there).

1. **I used this unlocker and my framerate is the same or below 60. Why?**

I say with great emphasis, as this seems to be a common misconception, that Roblox FPS Unlocker is an FPS _unlocker_ and not a _booster_. It will not boost Roblox's performance in any way and only removes Roblox's 60 FPS limit. To take advantage of RFU, a computer powerful enough to run Roblox at more than 60 FPS is required.

This being said, if you know your computer is powerful enough but still aren't seeing higher framerates with the unlocker, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker/issues/new).

1. **Can I set a custom framerate cap?**

Custom framerate limits can be set by changing the `FPSCap` value inside the `settings` file located in the same folder as `rbxfpsunlocker.exe` and reloading settings (RFU->Load Settings). Changing the cap with RFU's menu will reset/overwrite this value.

##  Disclaimer

Around June 21st, 2018 I received reports that Roblox was [handing out bans](https://i.imgur.com/i4NEGB0.png) to players using this tool. Roblox most likely assumes that `rbxfpsunlocker.dll` is an exploit or a cheat. I fixed this issue in [release 1.6](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker/releases/tag/v1.6) and can confirm injecting rbxfpsunlocker is now "invisible" to Roblox. **HOWEVER, this won't stop Roblox from releasing a new detection in the future. Please use this tool at your own risk** and keep in touch with this repository for updates.

**EDIT:** [Version 4.0](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker/releases/tag/v4.0) of Roblox FPS Unlocker further reduces the risk of bans or warns as DLL injection is no longer used. See the changelog for more information.

<sub>roblox this isn't an exploit no bans please :(</sub>
